        <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is beloved by many for his many classic film roles. While many fans know him as the star of movies like ‘The Terminator’ or family flicks like ‘Kindergarten Cop,’ he’s done so much more than just being a movie star. Aside from his acting, he was also the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. Besides his careers as an actor and politician, Arnold is also a loving father. He was married to Maria Shriver from 1986 until 2011, when they separated. During their relationship, the couple had four kids: Katherine, 32, Christina, 31, Patrick, 29, and Christopher, 24. It was later revealed that Arnold had fathered another son Joseph Baena, 24, with Mildred Baena in 1997. Arnold and Maria finalized their divorce in December 2021, and even though the couple have split up, it’s clear they still have a strong bond, through their kids. 

            Arnold smiled along with his then-wife Maria and their four kids at the premiere of ‘The Longest Yard’ in 2005.
